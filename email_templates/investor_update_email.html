	<p style="font-size: 10pt;"> Hello <b>{{name}},</b></p>
	<p id="para1"style="font-size: 10pt;margin-top: 5px;width: 560px";>The Yapster Team would like to thank you again for your support both financially and emotionally. We are proud to announce that we had a successful beta test with a total of 100 users! We had a total of 89 yaps, 429 minutes listened, 445 likes, and 103 reyaps. Through our beta we received great insight to ways to better our app that include adding text to walk the users through a variety of key functions, the need to optomize the app which we now have done, and lastly what we saw was deemed as "good" or "bad" content by the users. Users of the app according to activity and time listened, users loved daily content that usually dealth with the friends/family, news, sports, night life, and radio content. Today the app is now under review by Apple and is expected to be in the Apple App Store in the next 7-10 days. We currently have raised 45k to the point at which we are today. We are in talks with 5 other investors currently as we are finishing our raise of 30k more. Please let us know if you're interested in upping you investment. We have pre-raised a majority of our $1.5 million round and have been given goals to achieve. Those benchmarks are 10,000 users and a substantial growth rate (greater than 25%/50%). In the first week from launch we will have 5,000 directly acquired new users and in 2 weeks after launch we wll have 10,000 directly acquired new users. This will suffice our 10,000 user quota and give us a 100% growth rate perfect for our next round.
